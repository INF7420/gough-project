# My INF 7420 Project


I am going to be building a portfolio site. The purpose of this site will be to showcase my skills and keep my projects organized.

## Wireframes

The following is how my site will possibly be laid out.

Navigation Menu - will include links to other pages, such as the Contact Me page

Main Content - will include examples of past assignments and programs I have completed
