      I feel that the best presentation I completed thus far at Wayne State University is the program focused on marbles. My groupmates and I had to create a program for children in a library, complete with descriptions and pricing for items, based on an event from Chase's Book of Events, for the month with which we were assigned. We chose Marble Day, and came up with multiple games and activities which children could use marbles to complete. I definitely feel as if I could use it as a future program within my career one day.

    <p>One of the papers with which I learned the most was the paper I completed on my own management style. We had to use a variety of books and even a quiz within a book to help us determine our own personal management style. We also spent the semester learning about the varied types of management styles that there were. While I do not currently need to manage anybody within my workplace, I feel as if I learned a lot from this assignment, and could absolutely use it in my future as an information professional</p>
